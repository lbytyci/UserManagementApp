# User Management App - PersonaDesk

This project is a single-page application (SPA) built with React. It was created to demonstrate core front-end and full stack concepts, including component architecture and client-side routing.
The application retrieves and manages user data from a public API (jsonplaceholder) and includes full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, all via the React Context API for robust global state management.
A major highlight of this project is its deployment as a cross-platform desktop application using Electron. This involved customizing the UI to hide the native window frame and implementing IPC (Inter-Process Communication) to allow the React components to control desktop functions (like Minimize and Close).
